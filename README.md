# flowerchecker

aka yet another oisuite rewrite that i decided not to drop this time

this has less features than oisuite but the codebase is less cluttered so idc lol

to-do list
[x] testing capabilities
[x] projects
[x] test generation
[x] easy config editing
[x] git repo based
[ ] project search and indexing
[ ] new qcpp rewrite integrated in flowerchecker
[ ] multithreading tests (maybe)
